libbrv - a library to interact with Brick Rigs vehicles

A simple library for parsing, modifying and generating .brv 
(also known as Brick Rigs vehicle) files.

1. Why was it created?
After I've looked at blender brv plugin and BRCI I knew I would hate to work with them 
because of python. First, it is slow. BRCI takes 2 seconds to generate 30k bricks. And 
blender brv plugin takes 2 minutes to even load 10k bricks. So I've decided to make my 
time worth, picked C because I don't know any other language and started working on 
libbrv.

2. Features
- Ability to read and generate brv files from a bunch of parameters
- Ability to create intermediate representation of the vehicle.
- Speed, 0.04s to generate 30k bricks.

3. Installation / Compilation
First, make sure zig 0.13 is installed, haven't tested it on 0.14 yet. Then you can move 
forward with the instruction. After you clone the repository and get into it, you can 
type   zig build   in your terminal to compile the library. In the end you will get 
working library inside of ./lib/ I guess.

4. Quick start
But the library was faster. You don't need to do anything except for linking and 
including headers to make it work.

5. Debugging and troubleshooting
If you have any problems with vehicle parsing or generation make sure to send them in
issues tab of the repo. Make sure to include snippet of code responsible for generation
and .brv that you try to parse. 

6. Contributing
Every defenition should be lower case. Global functions and variables should have brv_
prefix. Commit names should be self-explainatory. Pull requests should contain issue id 
if it fixes it.
